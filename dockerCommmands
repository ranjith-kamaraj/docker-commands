Docker:  Virtualization Software

Docker -> Builded for linux based sys. But Docker desktop got introduced for Windows and Mac OS(To run linux based sys on windows and mac OS).

Docker vs VM: https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/

Docker adv. over VM:
1. Will take less disk space
2. Very fast to start


Will be run on OS application layer, Hardware -> Kernel -> OS App layer

Code + Package Everthing into Artifact
Can be easily shared and moved - Like a zip/tar/jar file

Zip/Jar file will be uploaded into Artifact repositry and be downloaded to server when its needed.

Docker Image:
Artifact - Is called as image. But it has code + complete enviroment configurations. Add dir, files and etc...

Contains: Application (JS App), Other Services(npm, node),  OS Layer(Linux)

Immuatble template that defines how a container will be realized.


Docker Container: 
Actually start the application

Running an instance of an image. That's when the container environment will be created.

One image -> But can run in multiple containers(multiple images running simultaneously) to improve the performance.
